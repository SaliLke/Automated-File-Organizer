# Automated-File-Organizer
As a personal project, I developed a Python application to sort the different files in a folder into new folders based on the file type or size (based on userâ€™s preference),  to undo the sorting, to move duplicate files into a folder and to rename the files in a regular manner. Python libraries : os, shutil and hashlib were used.
